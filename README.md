# Car-washing-simulation-using-a-Stack
A simple Python project that simulates a car wash line using the stack (LIFO) data structure. Cars enter the line using a push operation and are washed/removed using pop. Includes a menu-driven interface to add cars, wash cars, display the current line, and handle capacity limits. Useful for learning stack operations in a real-life scenario.
